# UI-Design-Daily--to--CSS
UI Design Daily designs, copied by me in HTML, CSS and JS
---------------------------------------------------------

This is a repo of different projects, which I've copied a design from the https://www.uidesigndaily.com/ website, then build myself using HTML, CSS and in some projects added JS functionality. Each project as the code and also the link in the readme file, to the original design from the UI Design Daily site.

I found trying to copy these design and build them using HTML and CSS, really improved my understand of both langauges. As I'm currently trying to learn more and learn JS, I've started adding on functionality to some of the designs as well.

Code improvments or advice is more than welcome! :)
